Simple project for a dog training button board that beeps when a button is pressed

## Background
I had a request to mount some buttons onto a board for a service dog trainer that is working on training dogs to press elevator buttons and light switches. They had three buttons: a standard momentary switch, a capacitive proximity momentary switch, and a decora light switch. Mounting them was simple enough on a left over piece of wood I had from a furniture restoration project. But of course I had to ask the question that any self respecting electronics hobbyist would ask: "Would you like it to beep?" and I was happy that the answer was yes.
